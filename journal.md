created a basic sketch , plan 
spent the whole time for rerserch apperantly xaio rp2040 can t support 16 keys 2 encoders and neopixels simultandeo.usly but toggle can do it so thats a good we can add a key to togle between the encoders and encoders so the function either of them will work this is sth new i learnt

csant add 2 rotatory encr der found a toggle switxh compromise that disables lasrt 2 switches to nabke adding 2 encoders
 change is needed i wanted to try 10 expander but now keypad will ho to io/ expander and the matrix will go to keypad and the encvoders neopixels to the xaio

the routing ias a pain i had to reroute readjust the nets continuously , autorouter kept failing
had to change the footprits for keys as there is problem with the skmini footprint i had to manually adjust change them there are al lot of drc error s in it
the keys footprint were a mess too some manual editing in that too
